Dear Examiner(s),

This is my coursework submission for term 2 of data 
netowrks. I have decided to build a basic web app 
that allows a user to add new users,add new products,
edit product details and remove products and search for 
products from the database. I have decided to call my 
web app 'GoldBuy' and took the time to design and develop 
a basic UI for the web app that has a consistent theme.
I've also implemented the google maps api using basic 
javascript and originally planned to fetch marker data 
from the database however due to time constraints I was 
unable to do this and therefore opted for a simple map 
of the University campus instead.

I've designed the front end based upon a 1766x768
resolution as I didn't have enough time to implement
media queries in CSS to make it responsive on more
devices.

And finally I've also included references to the material
I had refered to as a guide to help me learn and build
the web app using MVC. These can be found in both
php files and in the reference.txt file provided in
this repo and more documentation can be found within 
the code of the files.

Many Thanks,
Luke Houghton
